# Top 10 Statistics Mistakes Made by Data Scientists - Examples Code

Blog post available at https://github.com/d6t/d6t-python/blob/master/blogs/top10-mistakes-statistics.md

## Structure

`visualize.ipynb`: results notebook  
`task.py`: tasks for generating data and models  
`cfg.py`: parameters  
`run.py`: execute workflow tasks and push data  

The structure follows the d6tflow template for scalable data science projects available at https://github.com/d6t/d6tflow-template. It also makes use of d6tpipe to quickly share data to go with data science code see https://d6tflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/collaborate.html
